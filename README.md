# minesweeperCollab
Minesweeper Collaboration for AP CS Final Project 2019


This game was designed in three steps.
The first step was the backend. There is a square class that handles low level operations and stores data for a game object, which handles display output/interaction with the board, start/stop of game, and generation of mines.

TODO: Next, we will use a terminalIO GUI to verify performance and correct output of the game.

TODO: Finally, we will port this game to Processing, a version of Java with better pixel by pixel control than other versions, that will allow better drawing of a GUI than that of the quite frankly trash button management and object resizing in Swing/BreezySwing.
